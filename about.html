                <p>
                    At Iowa State, I was actively involved in extracurricular activities, including being a founding member of the Autonomous Robotics Club (ARC). The goal of ARC was to provide students with opportunities to learn autonomous coding skills, such as vision processing, control algorithms, and path planning. We used software such as Robot Operating System (ROS), OpenCV, Gazebo, PyTorch, and many other libraries. During my time in ARC I designed a competition ready robot for the IGVC competition, created a bill of materials for that robot, and converted that design into a virtual Gazebo environment so that the team to test their autonomous code prior to having a phisical robot. Aditionally I wrote python scripts to autonomously drive small robots around a scale city. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2023 I began my senior design project. The project involved a team of 13 people split into three sub-teams; Design, Aerodynamics, and Manufacturing. The project was a mock contract with NATO to design and build 3 sUAV's, one 10lb drone and two 1lb drones, to fly up to 7 miles away and deploy the smaller drone(s) into contested airspace to fly undiscovered to the target more than 2 miles away to deliver a 1 oz payload. I've had the pleasure to lead the design team throughout this project, creating many iterations of the drone designs over the 2023 semesters with the input from the other sub-teams. My responsibilities not only included my contributions to the design, but also motivating and managing my team, communicating and presenting ideas with the other sub-teams, and presenting our material to the professors. In November 2023 we finished building our prototype and successfully flew the drone system completing all of the mission objectives.

                <h4 id="bradley">Bradley University</h4>

                <p>In the fall of 2019, I began pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Bradley
                    University. During my first semester, I was given the opportunity to coach a <a
                        href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/FLL" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                        target="_blank">FIRST Lego League</a> (FLL) team, exposing young students to the engineering
                    design process, teamwork, and the concept of “<a
                        href="https://www.chs-robotics.org/gracious-professionalism-and-coopertition/"
                        rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">coopertition</a>.” After two years at Bradley,
                    I decided to transfer to Iowa State University to pursue a degree in Aerospace Engineering. I was
                    drawn to the field of Aerospace because of its emphasis on interesting applications in air and space
                    vehicles and mechanisms.</p>

                <h4 id="high-school">High School</h4>

                <p>My professional background in engineering began during my high school years when I joined the <a
                        href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                        target="_blank">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> (FRC) team <a
                        href="https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/2040" rel="external nofollow noopener"
                        target="_blank">DERT 2040</a>. Through FRC, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the
                    engineering design process, including brainstorming, design, and fabrication. Additionally, my
                    involvement in the program honed my leadership skills, as I held various leadership roles throughout
                    my four years on the team, including Lab Manager, Mechanical Lead, and Team Leader.</p>

                <p>As Lab Manager, I was responsible for ensuring safe use of the machine shop and providing training to
                    team members on safety protocols. As Mechanical Lead, I lead the design and fabrication process of
                    the robot, from the initial CAD model to final assembly. In this role, I also facilitated design
                    reviews and round-table discussions on strategy and progress. As Team Leader, I coordinated
                    communication between the five sub-teams and handled time and task management throughout the season.
                </p>

                <p>The experience and skills gained through my involvement in FRC have been invaluable to me,
                    particularly in regards to time and task management, conflict resolution, and the ability to rapidly
                    fabricate prototypes. I am excited to continue to develop these skills in my studies as an Aerospace
                    Engineering major at Iowa State University.</p>

                <p>During my junior year, I had the opportunity to secure a summer internship at Caterpillar through
                    connections made with my involvement in the FRC. As an intern in the Mechatronics Digital Engine
                    Test Room, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in a professional engineering setting.
                    My responsibilities included assisting with engine control module debugging, tabulating data,
                    running engine model test configurations, and contributing to the development of a new diagnostic
                    device for data collection. This internship provided me with valuable insight into the industry and
                    allowed me to apply the skills and knowledge gained through my involvement in robotics and
                    engineering design to a real-world setting.</p>
